📘 Data Science & AI Project
🎯 Project Overview

This project applies key Machine Learning techniques — including Regression, Classification, and Clustering — to analyze data, build predictive models, and uncover hidden patterns.
It demonstrates the full Data Science workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

🧹 1. Data Preprocessing
Step	Description
🧩 Missing Values	Handled missing values using median (numeric) and mode (categorical).
🔠 Encoding	Converted categorical variables to numerical form using Label Encoding.
⚖️ Scaling	Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler for better optimization.
🧪 Split	Divided dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
✅ Validation	Ensured dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.
📊 2. Regression Analysis
🎯 Objective

To predict continuous target values based on multiple input features.

⚙️ Steps

Applied Linear Regression model.

Evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Visualized Actual vs Predicted results using scatter plots for better interpretation.

💡 Key Insights
Metric	Purpose
MAE / MSE	Measures prediction error magnitude.
R² Score	Evaluates model performance.

✅ Regression successfully captured relationships between independent and dependent variables.

🤖 3. Classification Analysis
🎯 Objective

To classify data into predefined categories using supervised learning.

⚙️ Models Used
Model	Description
Logistic Regression	Baseline classifier for binary outcomes.
Random Forest Classifier	Ensemble model for higher accuracy and robustness.
📈 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Meaning
Precision	How many predicted positives were correct.
Recall	How many actual positives were detected.
F1-Score	Balances Precision and Recall.
Accuracy	Overall model correctness.

📊 Visualized results using bar charts and an Accuracy Comparison Graph.

🧠 Reflection:

“The most important metric for this project is F1-score, as it balances both precision and recall — ensuring that neither false positives nor false negatives dominate model performance.”

🔍 4. Clustering Analysis
🎯 Objective

To identify hidden patterns and natural groupings using Unsupervised Learning.

⚙️ Steps

Implemented K-Means Clustering to form clusters.

Applied Elbow Method to find the optimal cluster count.

Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction (2D visualization).

💡 Key Insights
Technique	Purpose
K-Means	Groups similar data points together.
PCA	Reduces features for easy visualization.

📉 Visualization revealed well-defined clusters, enhancing data interpretability.

📈 5. Visualization Highlights
Type	Visualization Purpose
📊 Scatter Plots	Showed Regression Predictions (Actual vs Predicted).
📉 Bar Charts	Compared Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy).
🌀 PCA 2D Plot	Displayed distinct Clusters from K-Means.

All visuals are designed for clear, data-driven storytelling.

🧩 6. Project Milestones
