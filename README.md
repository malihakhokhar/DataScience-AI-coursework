📘 Data Science & AI Project
🎯 Project Overview

This project applies key machine learning techniques — including Regression, Classification, and Clustering — to analyze data, build predictive models, and uncover hidden patterns.
It demonstrates the full workflow of a Data Science pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

🧹 1. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values using median (for numeric) and mode (for categorical).

Converted categorical variables to numerical form using Label Encoding.

Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler for model optimization.

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Ensured dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.

📊 2. Regression Analysis
Objective:

To predict continuous target values based on multiple input features.

Steps:

Applied Linear Regression model.

Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

Visualized Actual vs Predicted results through scatter plots for better model interpretation.

Key Insights:

Regression successfully captured relationships between independent and dependent variables.

The R² score was used as the primary evaluation metric to measure model performance.

🤖 3. Classification Analysis
Objective:

To classify data into predefined categories using supervised learning techniques.

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to assess model effectiveness.

Visual comparison through bar charts showing metric performance per model.

Added an Accuracy Comparison Graph to highlight overall predictive strength.

Reflection:

“The most important metric for this project is F1-score, as it balances both precision and recall — ensuring that neither false positives nor false negatives dominate model performance.”

🔍 4. Clustering Analysis
Objective:

To apply Unsupervised Learning for identifying hidden patterns and natural groupings in data.

Steps:

Implemented K-Means Clustering to form data clusters.

Used Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters.

Reduced dimensions to 2D using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization.

Visualized clusters with clear color separation for interpretability.

Key Insights:

PCA visualization revealed well-defined clusters.

Clustering added an unsupervised learning perspective, complementing regression and classification analyses.

📈 5. Visualization Highlights

Scatter plots for Regression Predictions

Bar charts comparing Classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy)

PCA 2D plot for Clustering results

All visuals designed for clear, data-driven storytelling
